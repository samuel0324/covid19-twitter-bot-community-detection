This project was initiated as capstone at BrainStation Online Data Sciene bootcamp.
It is still work in progress.

As someone interested in national security and information warfare, I ventured to use the skills I learned from this program
to detect bots in early COVID-19 tweets (tweets made between March 29th and April 30th, 2020).

The datasets were provided by Shane Smith on Kaggle.
Dataset 1 (early April tweets): https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-early-april
Dataset 2 (late April tweets): https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april

Notebook1 concatenates all the CSV files and selects only the English tweets.
Notebook2 contains data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.

Unsupervised learning, specifically KMeans clustering, was employed for modeling.
No conclusive results have come out, but useful insights have been discovered for building a bot profile.
Once a bot profile is established, it can be used in a supervised learning paradigm.
